## Some Code to Think About

The purpose of this repo is to share code and blog updates using distributed volume control. So far, the list of code is **very** modest. Over time, however, contributions from the blog of ChamberlainStatistics or of my own code, specifically, should find their way here.

## Areas of interest

This author is interested in Python, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), R, integrating Python into Excel (of course), research and scientific writing using various flavors of Markdown, and scientific and statistical programming.

## Contributions
Alas, one contribution to the scientific programming community written in VBA, some macros to assist with mass difference calculations, and some suggested forms of the calculations: [massDiff.bas](https://github.com/KeithChamberlain/KeithChamberlain/blob/master/massDiff.bas "Click to open massDiff.bas on GitHub").

Cheers!
