## Some Code to Think About

The purpose of this repo is to share code and blog updates using distributed volume control. So far, the list of code is **very** modest. Over time, however, contributions should find their way here.

## Areas of interest

This author is interested in Python, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), R, integrating Python into Excel (of course), SQL, SAS, research and scientific writing using various flavors of Markdown, and scientific and statistical programming.

## Contributions
Alas, one contribution to the scientific programming community written in VBA, some macros to assist with mass difference calculations, and some suggested forms of the calculations: [massDiff.bas](https://github.com/KeithChamberlain/KeithChamberlain/blob/master/massDiff.bas "Click to open massDiff.bas on GitHub"). There is also a version in R: [massDiff.r]().

Save the file to disk, then, in Excel, `right click` on a worksheet and click `View Code` to open the VBA editor for the current project (which may be a pre-existing project). `Right-click` anywhere on the project and `Import File`. `Select MassDiff.bas` to open, and a new module will be created called "massDiff". Now users can call massDiff() directly from within Excel (aka User Defined Function). If it doesn't work, it's pobably because the project needs to be trusted first. 

Cheers!
